# ingress Introduction ::::
Make your HTTP (or HTTPS) network service available using a protocol-aware configuration mechanism, 
that understands web concepts like URIs, hostnames, paths, and more. 
The Ingress concept lets you map traffic to different backends based on rules you define via the Kubernetes API.

- Ingress working in kubernetes as a incoming traffic entry point that control your routing and manangement 

- kubernetes have one single entry point using ingress

An Ingress does not expose arbitrary ports or protocols. 
Exposing services other than HTTP and HTTPS to the internet typically uses a service of type Service.Type=NodePort or Service.Type=LoadBalancer
