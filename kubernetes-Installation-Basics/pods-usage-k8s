# PODS :::::
- in the kubernetes pod is a smallest compute unit in that your container is running.
- pod is responsible for provide storage, security, contexts and network etc. for container. 
- kubernetes run every container and maintain using pod 
- pods is used for run application in kubernetes. 
- pod support one single container or multiple container (side-carcontainer, init container etc.)


# namespace :::: 
- in kubernetes namespace provide a logical space to segreate your enviornments 
- in kubernetes all services running in namespace
- default namespace is used if you not provide any namespace
- kube-system namespace is used manage kubenrentes key services. 

# service :::: 
- services is exposing method of applications. 
- service method provide 3 way to expose ClusterIP NodePort and Loadbalancer 
- in a clusterIP method pods can be accessiable by cluster machine only master and workers 
- NodePort method alloe to access your pods using external access but 
  pods expose on port range 30000-32767
- Loadbalancer if exist you can access you pods like in cloud env you have alb or azure loadbalancer 

# Deployment ::::
- kubernetes Deployment is a setof pods that manage your application. 
- Deployment used for application deployment that help to maintain Replica of Pods, manage high availability
- if you want to rollout and rollback and manage to upgrade . 


# Container-container svc communication 
- kubernetes pod to pod connection used using svc for that declare name 
- svc-name.namespace.svc.cluster.local    

# Persistent Volume and Persistent Volume Claim :::: 
- A PersistentVolume (PV) is a piece of storage in the cluster that has been provisioned by an administrator or dynamically provisioned.
- Persistsent storage is manage  details of the implementation of the storage, be that NFS, iSCSI, or a cloud-provider-specific storage system.
-


# Types of volumes supported by kubernetes for persistent volume
- awsElasticBlockStore (EBS)   azureDisk (Microsoft Azure Block storage)  azureFile( Nfs ) ElasticFileStorage ( aws nfs servive ) 
- cephfs  cinder  emptyDir fc (fibre channel)
- gcePersistentDisk (deprecated)   glusterfs   hostPath   iscsi  local  nfs   ( local storage management)
- accessmode: ReadWriteOnce ( Only One Node can Write and Read ); ReadWriteMany ( any pod can read and write); ReadWriteOncePod(only one pod allow to read and write ) ReadWriteMany
